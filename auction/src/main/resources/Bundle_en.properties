start.info.paragraph1=Our auction supports both direct and reverse types of auction. Direct (classic) - prices are gradually rising at the suggestion of the auctioneer or at the request of participants. Participants have the opportunity to revise their proposal depending on the actions of competitors. The winner is the one who appointed the highest price. Reverse (reverse, reduction) - is used not for the sale of the object of the auction, but for its purchase and the customer is the buyer. The price starts with a reserve maximum and is gradually reduced by the auctioneer (organizer of the auction), until there is a seller willing to sell the auction object at the suggested price.
start.info.paragraph2=In order to participate in the auction, please log in or register.
